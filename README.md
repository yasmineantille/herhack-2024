## Description
Welcome to Skyline Scoop! A media literacy web app for kids. This innovative platform empowers young minds to navigate digital information critically and effectively, addressing the growing influence of media on children.

The problem is significant: over 50% of American children struggle to identify fake news, highlighting the urgent need for media literacy education.

Skyline Scoop offers an interactive skyline filled with media literacy challenges. Students learn to construct cohesive articles by aligning content pieces, honing their skills in discerning and verifying accurate information in an engaging and educational manner.

Our solution is sustainable and impactful, building real-world skills essential for democracy. It reaches students nationwide, promoting inclusivity and creativity through socially inclusive content and a gamified detective theme that makes learning fun.
